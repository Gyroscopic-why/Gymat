# Zephyr
This is my attempt at making a chess engine 


## I will be using C# to make a simple chess engine in the console, planning to grow it later

It will be a small program in the beginning, only able to do basic chess engine stuff

But I am planni—Çg to grow it into a strong chess engine/bot in the future

# Current small plans for the near future for this project:
- UI will currently be only on english, however I will add russian UI later
- (+) Make a board parsing function in the console
- Make an Evaluation function
- Implement an optimised search algorith to calculate the positions
- Use multithread processing to increase the engines power and time efficiency
- Make the engine see CheckMates up to 3 full moves as of now

# :D
12.3.2025 - renaimed it from Gymat to Zephyr, 

Reason, quote:

_"Zephyr means a gentle breeze. The name reflects the lightness and elegance with which the engine solves complex problems, making it seem effortless and graceful."_
